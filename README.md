# This project focused on implementing and evaluating advanced strategies to improve the performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, Langchain, LangGraph pieline. Focus on:
1. RAG (Query Translation, Strategic Routing, Reranking and Hybrid GAG)
2. Langchain (Chain, Memory, Fuction-calling, Tools-routing)
3. LangGraph (AI Agent)
4. Using HDBSCAN and FAISS to explore and cluster products by the product's information
