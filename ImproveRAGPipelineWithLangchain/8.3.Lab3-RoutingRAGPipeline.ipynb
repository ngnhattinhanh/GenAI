It's formed when a massive star collapses in on itself and its gravity becomes so strong that it warps the fabric of spacetime around it.\n","\n","Imagine a sinkhole in spacetime, where everything that gets too close to the edge gets pulled in and can't climb back out. That's roughly the idea behind a black hole.\n","\n","Here's how it happens: when a massive star runs out of fuel, it collapses under its own gravity, causing a massive amount of matter to be compressed into an incredibly small point, called a singularity. The gravity at this point becomes so strong that it creates a boundary called the event horizon, which marks the point of no return. Once something crosses the event horizon, it's trapped forever.\n","\n","Now, here's the really cool part: black holes come in different sizes, ranging from small, stellar-mass black holes formed from the collapse of individual stars, to supermassive black holes found at the centers of galaxies, with masses millions or even billions of times that of our sun!\n","\n","So, that's a black hole in a nutshell (or a black hole, ha!).
