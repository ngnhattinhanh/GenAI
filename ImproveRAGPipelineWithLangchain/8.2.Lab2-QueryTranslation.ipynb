This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/'}, page_content='Fig. 1. Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/'}, page_content='[17] Bran et al. “ChemCrow: Augmenting large-language models with chemistry tools.” arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.05376 (2023).\\n[18] Boiko et al. “Emergent autonomous scientific research capabilities of large language models.” arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.05332 (2023).\\n[19] Joon Sung Park, et al. “Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior.” arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.03442 (2023).\\n[20] AutoGPT. https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT\\n[21] GPT-Engineer. https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/'}, page_content='LLM Powered Autonomous Agents\\n    \\nDate: June 23, 2023  |  Estimated Reading Time: 31 min  |  Author: Lilian Weng\\n\\n\\nBuilding agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept.

Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory')]"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":33}],"source":["# Retrieve\n","retrieval_chain = generate_docs_for_retrieval | retriever\n","retireved_docs = retrieval_chain.invoke({\"question\":question})\n","retireved_docs"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"604fcc36-a1d7-4096-99b5-50db30950fc5","metadata":{"id":"604fcc36-a1d7-4096-99b5-50db30950fc5","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1741664367529,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":15420,"user":{"displayName":"khanhblog AI","userId":"06481533334230032014"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# RAG\n","template = \"\"\"Answer the following question based on this context:\n","\n","{context}\n","\n","Question: {question}\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template)\n","\n","final_rag_chain = (\n","    prompt\n","    | llm\n","    | StrOutputParser()\n",")\n","\n","final_rag_chain.invoke({\"context\":retireved_docs,\"question\":question})"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"270dbd23-6f16-4827-a401-75889f0e3506","metadata":{"id":"270dbd23-6f16-4827-a401-75889f0e3506","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1741664367531,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":15422,"user":{"displayName":"khanhblog AI","userId":"06481533334230032014"}}},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.8"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
